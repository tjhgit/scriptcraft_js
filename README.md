The `scripts` folder holds all code that runs under `scriptcraft`. The `not_ported` folder contains js code from [learn-to-mod](https://www.learntomod.com/index.html) and still needs to be adapted to work with `scriptcraft`.

All these scripts can be tested in local minecraft-server as made available using a docker image, see `git/own/docker/minecraft_server` for details.
